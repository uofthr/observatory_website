    <title>Observatory - University of Toronto at Scarborough</title>

    <h1>The Astronomical Observatory at the University of Toronto Scarborough has ceased operations.</h1>

    <p>Unfortunately, due to new university priorities and recent construction work related to a new animal testing lab, it is no longer feasible to keep the observatory open.</p>

    <p>Until March 2019, the observatory was maintained by Hanno Rein (<a href="mailto:hanno.rein@utoronto.ca">hanno.rein@utoronto.ca</a>).</p>
